## 2: Predicting Failing Sensors for Windmill Turbines.

## Overview: 
"ReneWind" is a company looking to improve their process flow involving the failure of wind turbines via sensors on the turbines. 
They have shared a ciphered version of the sensor data (as the data is confidential). 
The data has 40 predictors, 20000 observations in the training set and 5000 in the test set.
The objective is to build several classification models and tune them. We are looking for the best one that will help identify failures so that the generators could be repaired before failing.
